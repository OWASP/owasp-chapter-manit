## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Chapter of MANIT, Bhopal! We're excited to announce the launch of our chapter dedicated to improving software and cyber security awareness among students.

At our chapter, we believe in starting with the basics of cybersecurity and gradually progressing to more advanced topics. Through workshops, seminars, and meetups, we aim to educate and empower students in the field of cyber security. We'll also be organizing Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and other events to test participants' skills and knowledge.

To ensure smooth conduct of our events, we are actively seeking volunteers. If you're interested in joining us and contributing to our cause, please reach out to any of the chapter leaders — we’d be thrilled to have you on board!

Together, let's build a strong community focused on enhancing cybersecurity at MANIT.
