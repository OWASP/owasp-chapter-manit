## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Chapter of MANIT, Bhopal! We are excited to announce the launch of our new chapter dedicated to improving software and cyber security awareness among students.

At our chapter, we believe in starting with the basics of cyber security and gradually progressing to more advanced topics. Through workshops, seminars, and meetups, we aim to educate and empower students in the field of cyber security. We will also be organizing Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and other events to test participants' skills and knowledge.

To ensure the smooth conduct of our events, we are actively seeking volunteers. If you are interested in joining us and contributing to our cause, please reach out to any of our chapter leaders. We value your support and would be thrilled to have you on board.

Together, let's build a strong community focused on enhancing cybersecurity at MANIT. If you are interested in joining us, please contact any of the chapter leaders. We will be happy to have you on board.
