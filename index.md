## Welcome  

<img src="assets/images/logo/owasp_manit_logo.png">  

Welcome to the **OWASP Chapter of MANIT, Bhopal**! We're excited to announce the launch of our new chapter, focused on improving awareness and knowledge of software and cyber security among students.  

Founded by passionate cybersecurity advocates, this chapter serves as a platform for students and enthusiasts to dive deep into the world of application security, ethical hacking, and secure software development practices.  

At OWASP Chapter MANIT, we believe in building from the ground up — starting with the fundamentals of cybersecurity and progressing to cutting-edge techniques. We conduct regular workshops, seminars, hands-on sessions, and Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions that challenge and grow participants' technical abilities.  

We are **actively seeking volunteers and contributors** to help us run and expand our events. If you're passionate about cybersecurity and want to make a difference, get in touch with any of the chapter leaders — we'd love to have you on board!  

Together, let's build a stronger, safer, and more secure digital world starting right here at MANIT.
