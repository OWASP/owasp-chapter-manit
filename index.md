## Welcome

Welcome to OWASP chapter of MANIT, Bhopal. We have started a fresh new chapter in MANIT to improve the awareness about software and cyber security. 

We want to start with the basics of cyber security and then move on to the advanced topics. We will be conducting workshops, seminars and meetups to spread the awareness about cyber security. We will also be conducting CTFs and other events to test the skills of the participants. 

We will be conducting regular meetups and call for volunteers to help us in smooth conducting of the events.

If you are interested in joining us, please contact any of the chapter leaders. We will be happy to have you on board.
