# OWASP MANIT Projects

The OWASP MANIT Chapter encourages students to contribute to open-source cybersecurity projects, collaborate on research, and develop tools that enhance software security. While our chapter is new, we’re laying the groundwork for exciting initiatives that align with OWASP’s mission.

## Current Projects
### Cybersecurity Awareness Portal
- **Description**: A web-based platform to educate students and the public about cybersecurity best practices, including tutorials on secure browsing, password management, and recognizing phishing attacks.
- **Status**: In development, led by a team of MANIT students.
- **How to Contribute**: Join our development team by contacting owasp.chap.manit@gmail.com. Skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or content creation are welcome!

### MANIT Secure Codebase
- **Description**: A repository of secure coding examples and guidelines tailored for MANIT students, focusing on mitigating OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in web and mobile applications.
- **Status**: Planning phase, seeking contributors for code samples and documentation.
- **How to Contribute**: Share your expertise in secure coding or documentation. Email us to get involved.

## Future Projects
- **CTF Challenge Builder**: A tool to create and host custom CTF challenges for our events, making it easier to design educational and engaging problems.
- **Vulnerability Scanner Plugin**: A student-led project to develop a plugin for existing OWASP tools (e.g., ZAP) to detect specific vulnerabilities in local web applications.
- **Cybersecurity Blog**: A platform for MANIT students to publish articles, tutorials, and CTF write-ups, showcasing their expertise and contributing to the community.
